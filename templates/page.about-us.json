Not only would he have to get his shoes at a small independent shoe store in Minneapolis which is now closed, and had little, if any, selection; it was the same store where his grandpa with extra large feet also shopped – which was kind of embarrassing for this young teenager.<br/><br/></p>",

He didn’t know how common it was for people with big feet to have their shoe size match their age until deep into their teenage years. Virtually all the customers at XLFeet have shared this same experience; and if you are a parent with a son following in those same footsteps, beware, it’s likely his feet are not done growing.<br/><br/>The struggle continued throughout his early adult life – difficulty finding everyday shoes, having to wear sneakers instead of boots when sledding in the snow, special ordering dress shoes when renting a tux, and no hope of finding skis, skates or other specialty footwear – problems that are too well known by those with extra large/wide feet.<br/><br/>One day while sitting in the math lab at college, Adrian noticed a foul odor and discovered it was the disintegrating soles of the cheap clearance shoes he was wearing. Beginning to fret about having to hunt down a pair of size 16 shoes again, it was frustrating as he always had to settle for very few shoes to choose from whether comfortable or not. And fashionable? That was out of the question. It was then that he committed to do something about it and started his own shoe company.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the founder/owner of XLFeet.com, Adrian knew footwear manufacturers were making extra large sizes yet few, if any, stores were stocking them. He did further research and asked around to find a way to connect with those manufacturers. Later at a shoe show in Las Vegas (with no knowledge about shoes, the lingo, or how to run a shoe store) he spoke to over 500 shoe manufacturers. Only one of those 500+ vendors let Adrian sell their shoes. The next year he went back and got three more brands.<br/><br/>He started the company out of his house and thought he would sell online only without a physical store. Adrian was still working full time selling cell phones in a retail store and had started XLFeet.com on the side.<br/><br/>Early in 2010 as sales began to trickle in, he bought a cargo van and put XLFeet.com decals on it thinking he might deliver the shoe store experience to his customers in the Minneapolis / St Paul Twin City area.<br/><br/>In 2012, XLFeet.com moved into its first physical store due to some shoe brands requiring the company to have a brick and mortar location. That year Adrian’s resources became dangerously low and he was referred to an organization called Microgrants by the Metropolitan Economic Development Association (MEDA.net) where he received a microgrant of just $1,000. This enabled him to pay for an opening order to add Florsheim as a brand to XLFeet.com.</p>",
